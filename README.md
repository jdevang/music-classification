# Music Classification

A web app that uses a CNN model to infer the genre of a song using its spectrogram.

The branches each contain code for their particular sections.

### Generating the CNN Model

This is being performed in the [cnn-code branch](https://github.com/junglesucks/music-classification/tree/cnn-code).

### Creating the dataset

The code for creating the dataset and cleaning it is present in the [dataset-creation branch](https://github.com/junglesucks/music-classification/tree/dataset-creation).

### Prototype

The final API code is present in the [prototype branch](https://github.com/junglesucks/music-classification/tree/prototype).
